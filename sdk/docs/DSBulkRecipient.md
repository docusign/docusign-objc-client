**identification** | **NSString*** | Specifies the authentication check used for the signer. If blank then no authentication check is required for the signer.

**phoneNumber** | **NSString*** | This is only used if the Identification field value is Phone or SMS. The value for this field can be a valid telephone number or, if Phone, usersupplied (SMS authentication cannot use a user supplied number).

**tabLabels** | [**NSArray&lt;DSBulkRecipientTabLabel&gt;***](DSBulkRecipientTabLabel.md) | Specifies values used to populate recipient tabs with information. This allows each bulk recipient signer to have different values for their associated tabs. Any number of &#x60;tabLabel&#x60; columns can be added to the bulk recipient file.  The information used in the bulk recipient file header must be the same as the &#x60;tabLabel&#x60; for the tab.  The values entered in this column are automatically inserted into the corresponding tab for the recipient in the same row.  Note that this option cannot be used for tabs that do not have data or that are automatically populated data such as Signature, Full Name, Email Address, Company, Title, and Date Signed tabs. | [optional]
