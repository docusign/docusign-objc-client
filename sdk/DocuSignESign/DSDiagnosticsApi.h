To view descriptions and samples of the service operations for all versions, remove the version number and add /help to the URL.

/// Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.  When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is set to true), REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log. A log can have up to 50 requests/responses and the current number of log entries can be determined by getting the settings. Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.  You can call [ML:GetRequestLog] or [ML:GetRequestLogs] to download the log files (individually or as a zip file). Call [ML:DeleteRequestLogs] to clear the log by deleting current entries.  Private information, such as passwords and integrator key information, which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.  ###### Note: API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user. Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId isn't logged. Meaning that login_information, NewAccounts, or other distributor-credential calls are not logged.
